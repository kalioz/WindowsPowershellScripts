# WindowsPowershellScripts

This directory hosts scripts I use on my work (Used on windows 10 Pro / Windows 8.1).
Some are meant to be faster, some are meant to avoid typing long sentences 10 times in a row, and some (90%) are meant to correct my fat fingers.

To run these scripts at each PowerShell startup, simply copy the contents of this folder in $HOME/WindowsPowerShell
